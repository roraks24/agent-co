/**
 * Reachability reporting for the FastAPI backend.
 *
 * There are two sources of evidence, and they are not equal:
 *
 *   1. REAL API TRAFFIC, reported through `reachability`. If any request came
 *      back — 200, 401, 500, it does not matter — the backend is up. This is
 *      the strongest signal available and it always wins.
 *   2. A GET /health probe, for the pages that make no API calls of their own
 *      (overview, reference, about). It is the weaker signal, and it is not
 *      allowed to contradict recent real traffic.
 *
 * THE PROBE GOES THROUGH `apiClient`, AND MUST. It used to be a bare `fetch`,
 * and twice that earned a bug where the probe failed against a backend that
 * ordinary traffic was reaching perfectly — first a `cache: "no-store"` that
 * forced a preflight (fixed in 234ef09), then a divergence that left the
 * overview page pinned to "waking" while the studio, one navigation away, went
 * online instantly off its very first request.
 *
 * The pattern is the defect, not either instance of it: a probe shaped
 * differently from real traffic tests a path that no real traffic takes, so it
 * can fail in ways nothing else does and report an outage that is not there.
 * Sharing the axios instance makes the probe *be* real traffic — same headers,
 * same interceptors, same CORS shape — so it cannot disagree with the requests
 * it is meant to be predicting.
 *
 * COLD STARTS. The backend is a free-tier Render service: it is suspended after
 * fifteen idle minutes and takes appreciably longer to boot than a single probe
 * is willing to wait. A probe that fails before the backend has *ever* answered
 * in this session is therefore not evidence of an outage — it is the expected
 * shape of a first visit. Until the cold-start budget is spent, such a failure
 * reports `waking`, not `offline`. A CORS rejection is exempt: the server
 * answered, so it is awake, and the verdict is immediate.
 *
 * OPTIMISTIC BY DEFAULT. The UI never claims a problem it has not actually
 * observed. `checking` and `waking` both mean "no evidence either way", and
 * both render as nothing at all -- no dot, no banner -- so the only way to see
 * a fault reported is for one to have been demonstrated. Reaching `offline`
 * therefore takes a spent cold-start budget AND repeated failures, because a
 * single failed request is a blip and this indicator is read as a verdict.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate: a false "online" costs a confused user one
 * failed run, while a false "offline" tells every visitor the product is
 * broken. Only the second is worth being slow and cautious about.
 *
 * States:
 *   unconfigured -> VITE_API_BASE_URL was never set in this build (definitive,
 *                   known before any request is made)
 *   checking     -> no evidence yet; renders as nothing
 *   waking       -> no evidence yet, and something has failed but not enough to
 *                   convict; renders as nothing
 *   online       -> the backend answered
 *   blocked      -> the server answered and refused this origin (definitive)
 *   offline      -> repeated failures, no traffic, cold-start budget spent
